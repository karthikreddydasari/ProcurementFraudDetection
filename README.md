# 🛡️ AI-Powered Fraud Detection for Transparent Governance

## 📌 Problem Statement

Fraudulent activities in government procurement result in billions of dollars in losses annually. Common types of **Procurement Fraud** include:
- Overpricing of goods and services
- Fake vendors receiving payments
- Violations of contract terms (substandard goods, delays)

These malpractices lead to delayed infrastructure projects, poor-quality services, legal consequences, and loss of public trust. Current detection methods are slow and manual.
